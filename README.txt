This directory contains MATLAB code for the 2nd edition of "Parameter Estimation and Inverse Problems" (2011-2012)
by Richard Aster, Brian Borchers, and Clifford Thurber.

The code in the "Examples" directory will recreate the corresponding MATLAB-based examples, including figures, for the textbook.

Ancillary files for the exercises, where needed, are located in the corresponding subdirectories of the "Exercises" directory.

To run this code, the "Lib" directory will have to be added to the user's MATLAB path.
